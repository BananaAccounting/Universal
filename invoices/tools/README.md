- tests/ch.banana.application.invoice.export.invoices.test.js: test for exporting invoices
- tests/ch.banana.application.invoice.export.items.test.js: test for exporting items
- tests/ch.banana.application.invoice.import.contacts.test.js: test for importing contacts
- tests/ch.banana.application.invoice.import.invoices.test.js: test for importing invoices
- tests/ch.banana.application.invoice.import.items.test.js: test for importing items

Test input test data is placed under:

- tests/testcases
